# Rock Paper Scissors game in JavaScript
## Now a GUI app!

I altered the instructions and instead made it so:  
* each game consists of three rounds
* the first to three wins that game
* the player has the option to play again or not, with the number of games won tracked across plays

## A few things I learned
* how to use transitions and animation in more complex ways
* it should be easier to interrupt an animation than having to trigger a DOM reflow
* got a lot of practice with eventListeners and the logic of using them in a GUI
* JavaScript's Math.R/random() is not as useful as C#'s
* the difference between nodeLists and arrays
* how to use callback functions
